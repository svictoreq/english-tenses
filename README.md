# English tenses
We are going to review all english tenses (16).

## Present simple

### Routines & Habits
It is used for routines and habits, e.g.
> I **play** tenis every Friday.

When it's used with _"he"_, _"she"_, or _"it"_; an _"s"_ must be added to the end of the verb, e.g.
> She **plays** tenis every Friday.

### Permanent situations
Present simple it's used in permanent situations, this is, that is not likely to change, e.g.
> I **live** in America.

As mentioned before, when using _"he"_, _"she"_, or _"it"_; an _"s"_ must be added to the end of the verb, e.g.
> He **lives** in America.

### Facts
We use the present simple with facts, e.g.
> Water **boils** at 100CÂº.

Note the use of the _"s"_ at the end of the verb.

## Present continuous

### _Right now_ situations
The present continuous is used with things happening at the moment, e.g.
> I **am having** my dinner.

The form is: `subject` + _`am/are/is`_ + `present participle (base + "ing")`. e.g.
> He **is walking** the dog.

> They **are running**.

### Temporary situations
It's used in not permanent situations, e.g.
> I **am staying** with my friend for two weeks.

## Past simple

### Finished action situation
The past simple is used in finished action situations, usually with a time reference, e.g.
> I **lived** in London for 5 years.

In this type of situation, we use verbs in the _past principle_ form.
Regular verbs used in _past principle_, often end with _"-ed"_, e.g.
> Lived, laughed, loved, walked, etc...

Irregular verbs are different: look [this article](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/regular-and-irregular-verbs), from the Oxford dictionary.

### Chronological order actions
We use the past simple when there are past actions that occurred in a chronological order, e.g.
> I **woke** up, **had** a shower, and then **left** for work.

## Past continuous

### Action that happened before and after a particular time in the past
We use the past continuous with actions that were already happening _before_ and _after_ a specific time in the past, e.g.
> I **was speaking** with my friend at 8 o'clock last night.

The form is: _`was/were`_ + `present participle (base + "ing")`.

### Parallel actions in the past
When telling actions that occurred in the past in parallel, we also use the past continuous, e.g.
> I **was reading** while she **was making** dinner.

We use the same form as before.

### Interrupted actions in the past
We use the past continuous when we tell actions that occurred in the past, but were interrupted by another action, e.g.
> I **was taking** a shower when my mom called me.

The form is the same.

### Action continued for some time in the past
When an action occurred in the past and continued for some time, we use the past continuous, e.g.
> Everyone **was singing**.

The form is the same as before.

### Action happening repeatedly in the past

## Present perfect simple

### Actions happening until now
The present perfect simple is used for actions or situations happening until now, usually not finished, that is, actions that started in the past, and are not finished yet, thus, they are going to be continued, until they're finished; e.g.
> I<strong>'ve started</strong> reading his latest book.

The form used is: _`has/have`_ + `past participle`.

### Life experiences
As life is not over, we use the present perfect simple for life experiences, because they're experiences from the past, but can happen again in the future, e.g.

The form is the same.

### Past action with a present result
For actions occurred in the recent past, which have had a result in the present, we use the present perfect simple, e.g.
